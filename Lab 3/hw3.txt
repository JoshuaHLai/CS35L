1. The Brady patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" since
   it was a repeated line in the code.  Removing the line would ensure
   that the script would not go back to the top of the switch statement
   again.

2. If the company I work for were to implement the patch, I would advise to
   be wary of using the patch in no-English speaking countries.  In the
   documentation of the patch, Brady suggests that this patch will work 
   strictly with the English time format, so it would not help countries
   who do not follow this format.

3. Here is the message that is printed out:
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
       main()
     File "randline.py", line 64, in main
       sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
     File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
     return random.choice(self.lines)
     File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
     return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if 
     seq is empty
   IndexError: list index out of range

   Clearly, we can see that the script is trying to access an element
   inside a list that has no elements.

4. Here is the message that is printed out:
   File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

   Here, the error changes from IndexError to SyntaxError.
   According to online documentation, the error indicates that exceptions in
   Python2 are iterable, but that function was removed in Python3.
