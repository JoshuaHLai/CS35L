Patching Software
Preface: Since this lab requires me to use the "sudo" command, I did the
process on my own personal machine.

To start out the lab, I used the following command:
"wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz," which downloaded
the tar file into my home directory.

To extract the files, I used the command "tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6-tar-gz"
which created a new directory called "coreutils-7.6."  Once the files were
extracted, I changed directories (cd coreutils-7.6) into the 
"coreutils-7.6" directory and created a new directory called "temp" with the
command "mkdir temp."

Next, I ran the following command:
"./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classlai/coreutils-7.6/temp/coreutils-7.6"
I did run into a few problems since the command required an asolute directory
name.  The reason I ran into this problem was because I set the prefix flag to
my home directory instead of the "temp" directory in "coreutils-7.6."  After,
I ran the "make" command and once that was finished, I ran the "make install"
command.

To reproduce the bug, I first changed to my home directory (cd).  Next, I
changed the locale by using the command "export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'."  To
make sure I was in the correct locale, I used the command "echo $LC_ALL."
Once that was finished, I changed directories (cd) into the bin directory
(~/coreutils-7.6/temp/coretuils-7.6/bin) where I ran the command
"ls -l /bin/bash," which showed the incorrect format of the date as shown:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 2015-12-22 01:12 /bin/bash

To patch the bug, I changed directories to my "coreutils-7.6" directory and
created a new file called "patching_file" where I copied the Brady patch.
To apply the patch, I used the command "patch -p1 < patching_file" to patch
the file, which went through with no errors.  After looking at "man patch,"
I saw that the flag -p1 will remove the leading forward-slash in the two files
at the top of "patching_file" (a/src/ls.c and b/src/ls.c).

Going to the top level of the source (src) tree, I ran the "make" command and
the following was the output:

For most of the directories, there wer no changes since they have nothing to
do with the ls.c file.  Overall, there were substantially fewer commands
executed in comparison to the first time I ran make.  Some of the files
changed were "dir.1," "vdir.1," and "ls.1" which were created due to
re-compiling the "coreutils-7.6" directory.

To check the patch was updated, I changed to the source (src) directory in
"coreutils-7.6" and used the commands "./ls -l" and "ls -l."  Here are the
outputs:
	./ls -l /bin/bash   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 Dec 22  2015 /bin/bash
	ls -l /bin/bash     -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 Dec 22  2015 /bin/bash

Since the outputs are the same, I know that the patch was applied correctly.
To check the difference between the a file and a file created a year ago,
I had to look at the "man touch" page.  Looking at it, I saw that the -t
flag will allow me to set the date it was created instead of the current
time. Using the following commands will show what are the differences between
the two files:
	touch -t 201601011111.30 check_file_new
	touch -t 201510011111.30 check_file_old
	./ls -l

Using the ls command worked on the old file, but it displayed the year instead
of the time since the last time it was "edited" was a year ago, so the year
will take precedence.  The ls command worked correctly with the new file.
