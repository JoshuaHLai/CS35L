For this part of the homework, I had to compare the performance of the three programs from this week's lab
and last week's lab: "sfrob" , "sfrobu" , "sfrobs"

For the test listed below, the first line indicates the command that was run and the time outputs I recevied
from the system based on the size of the file "homeworkTest.txt" with different number of lines of the text "Hello world!".
For the "sfrobu" file, I also included the number of comparisons made.

On 10 lines of "Hello world!"
	time ./sfrob < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.002s
		user    0m0.001s
		sys     0m0.000s

	time ./sfrobu < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.018s
		user    0m0.000s
		sys     0m0.001s
	Comparisons: 17

	time ./sfrobs < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.007s
		user    0m0.002s
		sys     0m0.006s

On 100 lines of "Hello world!"
	time ./sfrob < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.002s
		user    0m0.001s
		sys     0m0.001s

	time ./sfrobu < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.004s
		user    0m0.001s
		sys     0m0.002s
	Comparisons: 319

	time ./sfrobs < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.007s
		user    0m0.003s
		sys     0m0.005s

On 1000 lines of "Hello world!"
	time ./sfrob < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.003s
		user    0m0.001s
		sys     0m0.003s

	time ./sfrobu < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.007s
		user    0m0.000s
		sys     0m0.006s
	Comparisons: 4938

	time ./sfrobs < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.104s
		user    0m0.005s
		sys     0m0.109s

On 10000 lines of "Hello world!"
	time ./sfrob < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.014s
		user    0m0.012s
		sys     0m0.013s

	time ./sfrobu < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.059s
		user    0m0.013s
		sys     0m0.048s
	Comparisons: 64613

	time ./sfrobs < homeworkTest.txt
		real    0m0.162s
		user    0m0.030s
		sys     0m0.102s

From the tests that I have run, I have the following time points that I can use:
	Notation: (number of lines, comparisons)
	(10, 17)
	(100, 319)
	(1000, 4938)
	(10000, 64613)

Using these points, I was able to figure out a function f(x) such that:
	f(x) = 65.248485x - 635.4848485

Looking at the time points, we can see that "sfrob" tends to perform better than "sfrobu" since we know that "sfrobu"
utlizes system calls, which tend to take more time than using buffered I/O.  Overall, "sfrobs" tends to perform the worst
out of all of the executables, since using the bash shell uses an interpreted language and that piping in files for the
program takes more times to execute commands.
